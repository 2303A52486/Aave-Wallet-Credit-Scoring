#### **Score Range Behavioral Analysis**



###### **Score Range           Wallet Behavior Observed**



**0 - 250**       --->     These wallets are likely to experience liquidations or make withdrawals with little deposits. This behavior 				indicates exploitative use or uncontrolled risk.



**251 - 500**     --->     Here, excess leverage borrowing without matching repayment is common. Such wallets are risky in the middle segment 			and exhibit signs of unstable use.



**501 - 750**     --->     Balanced DeFi usage with high frequency of deposits and borrowing but with some late repayment or minor liquidation 			events. This level consists of average users with manageable risk.



**751 - 1000**    --->     These wallets always deposit, borrow in a prudent manner, repay in their entirety, and do not get liquidated. They 			are very dependable DeFi actors.



#### **Insights**



* **Healthy Wallets**: Regular deposits, controlled borrowing, timely repayments, and no liquidations.
* **Risky Wallets**: Overborrowing with poor repayment behavior or liquidations.
* **Red Flags**: Suspicious liquidation activity and wallets that cash out significantly more than they invest.



#### **Use Cases**



This scoring scale can help: 



* Identify wallets that can get discounted DeFi interest.
* Mark wallets for collateral update requirements. 
* Educate DeFi lending platforms on risk-based user segmentation.
